- In this project, I use the Machine Learning Regression (Time Series) method to predict the number of daily sales of Kalbe products
  - The main purpose of this analysis is to help the inventory team make sufficient daily inventory
  - Helps find out every daily product sold
- Apart from that, we also use the Machine Learning Clustering method to segment customers based on several criteria
  - The purpose of Clustering is to assist the marketing team in providing promotions and personal sales treatment to customers.
