- In this project, I use the Machine Learning Regression (Time Series) method to predict the number of daily sales of Kalbe products
  - The main purpose of this analysis is to help the inventory team make sufficient daily inventory
  - Helps find out every daily product sold
- Apart from that, we also use the Machine Learning Clustering method to segment customers based on several criteria
  - The purpose of Clustering is to assist the marketing team in providing promotions and personal sales treatment to customers.

- ðŸ“šConclusion and Recommendation
  - Conclusion
    - Based on the time series prediction results, the average number of products sold per day is 51.
    - The product with the highest sales is Thai Tea, with an average quantity of 8 per day, followed by Choco Bar and Ginger Candy, with an average quantity of 7 per day.
    - The product with the lowest sales is cashew, with an average of 2 per day.
  - Recommendation
    - Increasing the daily stock of Thai Tea, Choco Bar and Ginger Candy products to meet high customer demand.
    - Additionally, the lowest-selling products, such as Cashew, can be evaluated to determine whether there are opportunities to increase sales with marketing strategies or changes in product packaging or presentation.


### K-Means Clustering
- Data Frame Cluster
```python
df_cluster = df.groupby(['customer_id']).agg({ 'transaction_id': 'count',
                                              'qty': 'sum',
                                               'total_amount': 'sum'
                                               }).reset_index()
```
